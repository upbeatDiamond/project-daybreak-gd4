## A Gamepiece is a scene that is snapped to the [Gameboard].
class_name Gamepiece
extends Node2D

## Emitted when a gamepiece is about to finish travlling to its destination cell. The remaining
## distance that the gamepiece could travel is based on how far the gamepiece has travelled this
## frame. [br][br]
## The signal is emitted prior to wrapping up the path and traveller, allowing other objects to
## extend the move path, if necessary.
signal arriving(remaining_distance: float)

## Emitted when the gamepiece has finished travelling to its destination cell.
signal arrived
signal blocks_movement_changed
signal cell_changed(old_cell: Vector2i)
signal direction_changed(new_direction: Vector2)

## Emitted when the gamepiece begins to travel towards a destination cell.

## The gamepiece's position is snapped to whichever cell it currently occupies. [br][br]
## The gamepiece will move by steps, being placed at whichever cell it currently occupies. This is
## useful for snapping it's collision shape to the grid, so that there is never ambiguity to which
## space/cell is occupied in the physics engine. [br][br]
## It is not desirable, however, for the graphical representation of the gamepiece (or the camera!)
## to jump around the gameboard with the gamepiece. Rather, a follower will travel a movement path
## to give the appearance of smooth movement. Other objects (such as sprites and animation) will
## derive their position from this follower and, consequently, appear to move smoothly.
