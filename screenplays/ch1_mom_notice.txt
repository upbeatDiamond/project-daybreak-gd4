: Creak!
Mom: 
	Ah, ... the floor creaked, so you're awake.
	When you get a chance, come outside.
	I've been working on something and I need someone to try it.

+ Me?
	<Player>: ...? #curious
	Mom: Yes, you.
	<Player>: ... #blush
+ Uncle?
	<Player>: ...? #curious
	Mom: And no, it can't be your uncle.
	<Player>: ... #unamused
