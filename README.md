# project-daybreak-gd4
A project for me to learn/practice Godot, SQLite, Inkscape, GOAP, localization, etc.

Ideally, an RPG.

All code is derived from MIT licensed repos, or more permissive, except mine and Arkeve's, which is minimal and being phased out.
If you wish to contribute, tell me explicitly and clearly how you want to be credited.

Explicitly designed based off of 2 franchises, one about phones and one about capsules.
