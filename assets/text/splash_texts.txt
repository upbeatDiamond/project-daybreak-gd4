None are beyond judgement.
All stories are fiction, some convey truth.
Unity begets strength, diversity begets resiliance.
It takes all colors to make a rainbow.
A world where anything is possible. 
It's beautiful, the creation of words.
Hope lies in the masses.
United we stand, divided we fall.
Any excuse will serve a tyrant. 
In critical moments, even the most powerful have need of the weakest. 
No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.
The mind has trouble letting go.
You're just a small part of the world.
Keep your heart blazing.
To be good, and to do good, is all we have to do.
Times change, and we change with them.
If you donâ€™t like someone, you must get to know them better.
Every expert was once a beginner.
There's good in everybody.
A leadership is someone who brings people together.
We are the change that we seek.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
