NOTES:
- Commas as separators might be optional. Don't count on it.
- Footer and header tags can be used outside of their context, but...
	... they would have undocumented and unstable behavior. Avoid using.
- I am enabling using unstable behavior. Muahahah.
- If a 'say' line has no speaker and no non-whitespace text, that's a "dialog hide"
- Default actors that a scene should always have are @Player and @Partner. 
	If no partner, then just speak to yourself in your own head.
