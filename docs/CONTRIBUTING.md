## Code <a id="code"></a>

If you wish to contribute code, please fork the project.
Ensure all code additions under a license compatible with the MIT license.
Ensure all assets enable commercial use and modification (not CC-BY-ND)

Development is projected to occur over five stages; we are now in Pre-Alpha:

Pre-alpha
 - Working off of a to-do list and changelog text file
 - Objective is to get features produced and process developed
 - Releases indicate milestones in features
 - Move on to Alpha once all key features are present

Alpha
 - Unstable, working towards stability
 - Commits should now follow Conventional Commits
 - Versioning should now follow format 0.0.z
    - 'z' is an update
 - Move onto Beta once all important features are stable

Beta
 - Stable, working towards polish
 - Commits should now also follow the 'issues' tab
 - Versioning should now follow format 0.y.z; API might not be stable
    - 'y' is a milestone, 'z' is a patch/fix
 - Move onto Gamma once the game is deemed sufficiently developed

Release / Gamma
 - Stable, polished, working towards convenience.
 - The game can be played during version 1.0.x and feel complete.
 - Semantic versioning should now be used, following x.y.z
    - 'x' increments when an incompatible API change occurs
    - 'y' increments when a feature is added, with backwards compatibility
    - 'z' increments when an issue is patched
 - Gamma and Delta stages likely overlap.

DLC / Delta
 - Focus on writing a post-mortem
 - Focus on distribution
 - Work on making/enabling expansions in separate branches/repos



## Assets <a id="assets"></a>

A great way to contribute is to provide assets.

There will eventually be a centralized list of what assets are desired,
as well as what assets have been acquired.

All assets present in the project must be made and licensed with intent to be
used in this project and its derivatives, or must come under a public license
such that anyone may sell this project, should the project become completely
libre.

For simplicity, CC0, CC-BY, and CC-BY-SA are desired for inclusion,
while CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-ND, and CC-BY-NC-ND are avoided for inclusion.
WTFPL is are good too.

All assets must be properly credited, or fall under public domain or CC0, else
be redacted from the project. Assets brought in by contributors should come 
with a source link to an externally hosted mirror. That is, if you make the 
asset (as in graphic or music), please put it on a website, and link that 
website. Make a social media post, or a neocities page, and if you find the
asset from somewhere else, link the origin.
