Development is projected to occur over five stages; we are now in Pre-Alpha:

Pre-alpha
 - Working off of a to-do list and changelog text file
 - Objective is to get features produced and process developed
 - Releases indicate milestones in features
 - Move on to Alpha once all key features are present

Alpha
 - Unstable, working towards stability
 - Commits should now follow Conventional Commits
 - Versioning should now follow format 0.0.z
    - 'z' is an update
 - Move onto Beta once all important features are stable

Beta
 - Stable, working towards polish
 - Commits should now also follow the 'issues' tab
 - Versioning should now follow format 0.y.z; API might not be stable
    - 'y' is a milestone, 'z' is a patch/fix
 - Move onto Gamma once the game is deemed sufficiently developed

Release / Gamma
 - Stable, polished, working towards convenience.
 - The game can be played during version 1.0.x and feel complete.
 - Semantic versioning should now be used, following x.y.z
    - 'x' increments when an incompatible API change occurs
    - 'y' increments when a feature is added, with backwards compatibility
    - 'z' increments when an issue is patched
 - Gamma and Delta stages likely overlap.

DLC / Delta
 - Focus on writing a post-mortem
 - Focus on distribution
 - Work on making/enabling expansions in separate branches/repos
