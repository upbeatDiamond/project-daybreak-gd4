Welcome to crude changelog, the log that gets facts wrong about your favorite changes.
I'm jan Wiwijen (jan Opitaman), and today we'll be discussing an alpha version of an unnamed project.

Codename: Project Daybreak
Update: Prealpha "What's Goin Down"

Notable additions:
	+ Tree object and associated assets
	+ Grass object and associated assets
	+ Adopted minute amounts of code from https://github.com/food-please/godot4-open-rpg
		* Will be phasing out Arkeve style movement code
		* In testing and editing, some files may have been altered such that they signal as "corrupted". This is fine.
		+ Due to adoption failure, player.tscn has been replaced with a different MIT license code to be expanded upon.
	+ Started blocking out the failsafe (used to trap errors) (itself causes so many errors)
		+ By extension, added new tileset, shader, and sounds, although only the tileset is used


Notable subtractions:
	- Depends on when we're subtracting from.


Notable changes:
	* Renamed aspects of MonsterBattleAI, and expanded upon it
	* Extracted parts of GlobalMove's CalculateRawDamage and used those funcs in MonsterBattleAI
	* Renamed 'effect' to 'moveeffect' in both filenames and database, to account for vfx, sfx, and effecting
	* Renamed GlobalBitfieldManip to GlobalBitManip to roll off the tongue better, and expanded functionality
	* Changed folder name 'Static' to 'Global'
	* Due to insertion of Gamepiece, Grid, and associated objects, all RedTown objects were moved to positive coords.
		* Due to removal of original Gamepiece & Grid code, its features will be implemented independently and gradually.


Commentary:
	> Code that is reused often, or is otherwise bulky, should be moved to "global" classes.
	> That way, I don't have to worry about whether the code is duplicating the same functions, enums, etc.
	> Only issue then would be too many "global" (autoload) classes.
	
	> This whole thing is a redo for multiple reasons including: 
		> Being confused between code and asset licensing in the GitHub repository settings
		> Following tutorials from unknown license repositories
		> Improper credits documentation
		> Outdated version of Godot
		> Setting up is the funnest part once you know how to do it. Expanding and bugfixing on the other hand...?
	
	> Since I've yet to give this project a proper name, just a version name... what about something with "Animus"?
		> Animus for soul, heart, emotion, etc from Latin
		> Animus for 'animal'
		> Animus for 'animated'
		> Animus for 'animosity'
