Welcome to crude changelog, the log that gets facts wrong about your favorite changes.
I'm jan Wiwijen (jan Opitaman), and today I'll be discussing a pre-alpha version of a Godot project.

Codename: Project Daybreak
Update: Pre-alpha 3
TL;DR: idk yet



Notable additions:
	+ D* Lite algorithm code
		+ Various unused code related to the above
	+ Prototype "Port Town", and accompanying tiles to practice town design & teleports
	+ Prototype "Bridge Town", used to test pseudo-3D maps, Ã  la MyHouse
	+ Added more code to the combatants and combat scene (still not usable)
		+ Added more graphics and GUI elements for the combat scene
	+ Always more graphics and sounds that aren't used (yet)
	+ Added GamepieceController for player (mostly works) and 'mob' (mostly doesn't)
	+ Added Portal to teleport gamepieces within, or across, maps
	+ Added Gametoken to represent items and HM props


Notable subtractions:
	- Multiple scripts I did not develop, or have otherwise replaced
		- player[#].gd's are being replaced with gamepiece_controller_player.gd




Notable changes:
	* Changed daylight cycle to try to increase visibility at night
	+ Added more functionality to the Player Menu, seen through the 'exit' button working
		+ Pausing can now happen while the player (or any gamepiece, I hope) is moving
	* Put all new Player functionality into Gamepiece and then replaced Player with a Gamepiece
		- Some old functionality might be broken...
		* Tween is now tied to a variable that can be paused on a signal
		+ Gamepieces now have a movement queue, which is intended for cutscenes and ice physics
	* Split CurrentScene into InterfaceWorld and InterfaceActivity(+Wrapper) for easier transitions


To do eventually:
	% Redo all the Arkeve tutorials, but with substituted code
	% Follow the Chris' Tutorials videos, mix with GDQuest for the battle scene
	% Fix and finish the failsafe map's generation code, otherwise it's not very safe
		% Make the shader actually do something, and put it in a nicer folder
	% Fix the ledge graphics
		% Split rock and dirt tiles visually
		% Make the top edge closer match the collision box
	% When Godot 4.1 happens, turn some Global classes into Static fields like they're meant to be
	% Change between overworld & battle via add_child() and remove_child() perhaps
	% I have 2 options: I can mix NavServer, NavLink, and A*Grid, or I can make a new D*Server...


General Commentary:
	> Code that is reused often, or is otherwise bulky, should be moved to "global" classes.
	> That way, I don't have to worry about if the code is duplicating functions, enums, etc.
	> Only issue then would be too many "global" (autoload) classes.
	
	> This whole thing is a redo for multiple reasons including: 
		> Being confused between code and asset licensing in the GitHub repository settings
		> Following tutorials from unknown license repositories
		> Improper credits documentation
		> Outdated version of Godot
		> Setting up is the best part once you know how. Expanding & bugfixing though...?
		
	> No sources should be less permissive than an MIT license. Everything in here should be free.
