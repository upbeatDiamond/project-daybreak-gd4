Welcome to crude changelog, the log that gets facts wrong about your favorite changes.
I'm jan Wiwijen (jan Opitaman) (mije meli (mi ken ala ken jan tonsi? n ala!)), 
and today we'll be discussing an unnumbered version of an unnamed project.
(Je suis un programmeur, apparemment)

Codename: Project Daybreak, push name: The Starting Line
Reasoning: Continuing the previous name trend, but with Neil Cicierega <3



Notable additions:
	+ Tree object and associated assets
	+ Grass object and associated assets
	+ Adopted code from https://github.com/food-please/godot4-open-rpg
		* Will be phasing out Arkeve style movement code in favor of food-please style
		* In testing and editing, some files may have been altered such that they signal as "corrupted". Regardless, all data is either recoverable or recreatable.
	+


Notable subtractions:
	-


Notable changes:
	* Renamed aspects of MonsterBattleAI, and expanded upon it
	* Extracted parts of GlobalMove's CalculateRawDamage and used those funcs in MonsterBattleAI
	* Renamed 'effect' to 'moveeffect' in both filenames and database, to account for vfx, sfx, and effecting
	* Renamed GlobalBitfieldManip to GlobalBitManip to roll off the tongue better, and expanded functionality
	


Commentary:
	> I don't remember what's in the previous version. 
	> Also I'll be updating this using the desktop apps in between pushes, so some versions may be unnamed.
	> This is good, actually. Don't want stuff to be clogged with goofy titles.
	
	> Code that is reused often, or is otherwise bulky, should be moved to "global" classes.
	> That way, I don't have to worry about whether the code is duplicating the same functions, enums, etc.
	
	> This whole thing is a redo because the previous version was a Godot 3.X project using Arkeve's tutorials, 
	> including copyrighted assets. I replaced them with CC-BY, but I got confused between code and asset licenses,
	> so I'm starting over by incorporating more tutorials and only CC0 or custom assets for now. Also GD 4.0.2
	
	> Cool words: Eoan, Benight, fere
