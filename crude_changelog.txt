Welcome to crude changelog, the log that gets facts wrong about your favorite changes.
I'm jan Wiwijen (jan Opitaman), and today I'll be discussing a pre-alpha version of a Godot project.

I'm merging July/August into one release so I can give myself more time to fix stuff.



Codename: Project Daybreak
Update: Pre-alpha 4
TL;DR: 



Notable additions:
	+ Added part of code for transfering gamepieces to proper map based on map indexes



Notable subtractions:




Notable changes:



To do eventually:
	% Replace the remaining Arkeve tutorial code after prototyping his party screen system
	% Follow the Chris' Tutorials videos, mix with GDQuest for the battle scene
	% Fix and finish the failsafe map's generation code, otherwise it's not very safe
		% Make the shader actually do something, and put it in a nicer folder
	% Fix the ledge graphics
		% Split rock and dirt tiles visually
		% Make the top edge closer match the collision box
	% Move the TitleScreen to the ActivityInterface
	% Fix or replace the D* pathfinding
	% If a level has an Objects and Y-Sort, put Gamepieces there, else make the level have them.


General Commentary:
	> Code that is reused often, or is otherwise bulky, should be moved to "global" classes.
	> That way, I don't have to worry about if the code is duplicating functions, enums, etc.
	> Only issue then would be too many "global" (autoload) classes.
	
	> This whole thing is a redo for multiple reasons including: 
		> Being confused between code and asset licensing in the GitHub repository settings
		> Following tutorials from unknown license repositories
		> Improper credits documentation
		> Outdated version of Godot
		> Setting up is the best part once you know how. Expanding & bugfixing though...?
		
	> No sources should be less permissive than an MIT license. Everything in here should be free.
